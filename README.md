# seqHelpers

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of seqHelpers is to provide easy access to helper functions for bulk
RNA-Seq analysis using edgeR. As with my flowHelpers package, this is not
intended for distribution (although I'm making it public for easy sharing with
colleagues and in case I can be helpful to others), so it's jankier than a
normal package would be, and might be full of undocumented crap. If you want to
use something in here, go for it, but be prepared for some work on your end.

## Installation

you can install the current version of seqHelpers using devtools, like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("NKInstinct/seqHelpers")
```
